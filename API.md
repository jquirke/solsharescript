# Allume Energy / SolCentre API

Reverse-engineered from the SolCentre customer portal JS bundle.

## Base URL

```
https://api.allumeenergy.com.au/v2
```

## Authentication

### Login

```
POST /auth/customer-login
Content-Type: application/json

{ "email": "<email>", "password": "<password>" }
```

**Response `201 Created`:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "<JWT>",
  "user": {
    "id": "<userId>",
    "email": "<email>",
    "firstName": "<firstName>",
    "lastName": "<lastName>",
    "role": "Consumer",
    "activated": true,
    "tcAccepted": true,
    "emailVerified": true,
    "createdAt": "...",
    "updatedAt": "..."
  }
}
```

The `accessToken` is a JWT. All subsequent requests must include:

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

## Energy Snapshot Endpoints

Date parameters (`from`, `to`) are **Unix timestamps in seconds** (not milliseconds).
The `to` value is exclusive — to fetch a single day, set `to = from + 86400`.

### Hourly Snapshots by Property

```
GET /properties/{propertyId}/snapshots?type=hourly&from={unixSecs}&to={unixSecs}
```

**Example** — fetch 25 Feb 2026:
```
GET /properties/<propertyId>/snapshots?type=hourly&from=1771977600&to=1772064000
```

**Response `200 OK`** — array of hourly records:
```json
[
  {
    "startAt": "2026-02-25T00:00:00.000Z",
    "endAt":   "2026-02-25T01:00:00.000Z",
    "energyDemand":     0.28,
    "solarConsumed":    0.28,
    "solarDelivered":   0.52,
    "solarExported":    0.23,
    "emissionReduced":  0.348244,
    "emissionReducedUnit": "kg"
  },
  ...
]
```

| Field | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `startAt` / `endAt` | ISO 8601 | Start and end of the hour window |
| `energyDemand` | kWh | Total electricity consumed by the property |
| `solarConsumed` | kWh | Solar energy actually used by the property |
| `solarDelivered` | kWh | Solar energy delivered to the property (consumed + exported) |
| `solarExported` | kWh | Solar energy exported to the grid from the property |
| `emissionReduced` | kg CO₂ | Emissions avoided by using solar |

**Derived values:**
- `gridImport = energyDemand - solarConsumed`
- `solarSelfConsumptionRate = solarConsumed / solarDelivered`

**Field notes:**
- Despite the endpoint being named `type=hourly`, the actual bucket size depends on the query window — narrow windows return finer-grained buckets (see [Observed Behaviour](#observed-behaviour) below).
- `solarDelivered` ≠ `solarConsumed` + `solarExported` in all cases — small discrepancies observed, possibly due to rounding or metering losses. Do not assume they are identical.
- `solarConsumed` can be negative in raw API responses; clamp to 0 before use.

### Hourly Snapshots by Project

```
GET /projects/{projectId}/snapshots?type=hourly&from={unixSecs}&to={unixSecs}
```

### Hourly Snapshots by Meter

```
GET /meters/{meterId}/snapshots?type=hourly&from={unixSecs}&to={unixSecs}
```

## Observed Behaviour

Findings from empirical testing (2026-03-04/05).

### Bucket granularity scales with query window

Despite `type=hourly`, the API returns sub-hourly buckets when the query window is narrow:

| Query window | Observed bucket size |
|---|---|
| 5 minutes | 5 minutes |
| 1 hour | 5 minutes |
| 6 hours | 1 hour |

The exact threshold where it coarsens is unknown — somewhere between 1 hour and 6 hours. Querying hour-by-hour is a reliable way to get 5-minute resolution across a longer period.

**Uncertainty:** It is not known whether this behaviour is intentional, documented, or stable across API versions.

### Data latency

Data appears in the API within ~1 minute of the interval closing. A 5-minute bucket ending at 01:05 was visible by 01:06. This makes the API suitable for near-real-time monitoring applications.

**Uncertainty:** Only tested at night (no solar generation). Latency during peak generation hours is unknown and may differ.

### Solar generation volatility (2026-03-04, partly cloudy)

Analysed 72 × 5-minute `solarDelivered` readings from 12:00–18:00 AEDT:

- **Min/Max:** 0.00 / 0.17 kWh per 5-min interval
- **Coefficient of variation:** 114% — highly volatile signal
- **Largest single-step drop:** 87% in one 5-minute interval (cloud event at 13:10)
- **Zero-delivery periods:** 18% of intervals; two sustained outages of 30 min and 20 min between 14:15–15:10
- **Most stable hour:** 16:00–16:55 (CV ~35%), low but consistent

Implication: the raw 5-minute signal is too noisy for direct HVAC actuation. A 15-minute rolling average with hysteresis is recommended for demand-shedding applications. Future work: correlate with BOM weather/cloud cover data and clear-sky irradiance model to separate cloud events from sun-angle decline.

### Load detection experiment (2026-03-05)

Ran a dryer (no load) from 01:00–01:08 AEDT to test whether individual appliance loads are detectable.

Results:

| Bucket | Demand |
|---|---|
| 00:55 (baseline) | 0.07 kWh |
| 01:00 (dryer on) | 0.06 kWh |
| 01:05 (dryer on) | 0.08 kWh |
| 01:10 (after) | 0.06 kWh |

The dryer produced only ~0.02 kWh above baseline per 5-minute bucket — approximately 240W apparent load. This was lower than expected and is likely explained by:
1. No clothes in the drum (minimal thermal load)
2. The 8-minute run straddling the 01:05 bucket boundary, diluting the load across two buckets

**Planned follow-up:** repeat with a full load of clothes, starting at a non-boundary time (e.g. :17 or :23) to land the bulk of the load inside a single 5-minute bucket.

## Notes

- The portal is a Vue.js SPA served from `https://solcentre.allumeenergy.com`
- The API is at a separate origin (`api.allumeenergy.com.au`)
- JWT tokens have a ~14-day expiry (`exp` claim)
- Timestamps in API responses are UTC; the `$g()` frontend function passes a UTC offset as a third parameter to snapshot calls — this may affect how daily boundaries are computed server-side
